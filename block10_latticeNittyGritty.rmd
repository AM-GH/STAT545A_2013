Backfilling some technical info on `lattice`
========================================================

```{r include = FALSE}
## I format my code intentionally!
## do not re-format it for me!
opts_chunk$set(tidy = FALSE)

## sometimes necessary until I can figure out why loaded packages are leaking
## from one file to another, e.g. from block91_latticeGraphics.rmd to this file
if(length(yo <- grep("gplots", search())) > 0) detach(pos = yo)
if(length(yo <- grep("gdata", search())) > 0) detach(pos = yo)
if(length(yo <- grep("gtools", search())) > 0) detach(pos = yo)
```

Now that you have made many `lattice` plots, let's fill in some technical details that will help you become even more effective in your use of `lattice`.

### Optional getting started advice

*Ignore if you don't need this bit of support.*

This is one in a series of tutorials in which we explore basic data import, exploration and much more using data from the [Gapminder project](http://www.gapminder.org). Now is the time to make sure you are working in the appropriate directory on your computer, perhaps through the use of an [RStudio project](block01_basicsWorkspaceWorkingDirProject.html). To ensure a clean slate, you may wish to clean out your workspace and restart R (both available from the RStudio Session menu, among other methods). Confirm that the new R process has the desired working directory, for example, with the `getwd()` command or by glancing at the top of RStudio's Console pane.

Open a new R script (in RStudio, File > New > R Script). Develop and run your code from there (recommended) or periodicially copy "good" commands from the history. In due course, save this script with a name ending in .r or .R, containing no spaces or other funny stuff, and evoking "technical background" and "lattice".

### Load the Gapminder data, drop Oceania, load packages

Assuming the data can be found in the current working directory, this works:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
gDat <- read.delim("gapminderDataFiveYear.txt")
```

Plan B (I use here, because of where the source of this tutorial lives):
```{r}
## data import from URL
gdURL <- "http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/notOcto/STAT545A/examples/gapminder/data/gapminderDataFiveYear.txt"
gDat <- read.delim(file = gdURL)
```

Basic sanity check that the import has gone well:
```{r}
str(gDat)
```
Drop Oceania, which only has two continents
```{r}
## drop Oceania
jDat <- droplevels(subset(gDat, continent != "Oceania"))
str(jDat)
```

Load the `lattice` and `plyr` packages.
```{r}
library(lattice)
library(plyr)
```

### High level `lattice` functions actually return objects

```{r}
myAwesomePlot <-
  xyplot(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap | continent, jDat,
         scales = list(x = list(log = 10, equispaced.log = FALSE)),
         type = c("p", "smooth"), grid = TRUE, col.line = "darkorange", lwd = 4)
```

Hello? Where is the plot? Our previous plots have been appearing in a graphics device on your screen (and inserted into this document) because, by default, the `print()` method for objects of class `trellis` has been dispatched on the return value of our high-level `lattice` commands. If you make an assignment, as we did above, or if the command is wrapped inside a function, inside a `plyr` call, or inside a loop, automatic printing will not occur. To explicitly print the figure use `print()` or `plot()`.

```{r}
print(myAwesomePlot)
```

It is possible to do other things to a `trellis` object, such as `update()` or `summary()` but I rarely do.

### Putting more than one `lattice` plot on a "page"

Another reason to assign the object and call `print()` explicitly is to exploit additional arguments (read the help on `print.trellis()` to see them all). The ones you will use most facilitate the placement of more than 1 figure on a page; the arguments are`pos =` and `split =`. Here we use `print(..., pos =...)` to arrange two plots together.

```{r fig.width = 12}
myOtherPlot <- stripplot(lifeExp ~ reorder(continent, lifeExp),
                         subset(jDat, subset = year %in% c(1952, 1977, 2007)),
                         groups = year, auto.key = list(reverse.rows = TRUE),
                         jitter.data = TRUE, type = c("p", "a"), fun = median)
print(myAwesomePlot, pos = c(0, 0, 0.52, 1), more = TRUE)
print(myOtherPlot, pos = c(0.48, 0, 1, 1))
```

The `split =` argument is also useful for this purpose but I prefer `pos =` because I can specify a wee bit of overlap to reduce whitespace between the plots. In the calls above, note that the lefthand plot runs from the far left to just past the halfway mark and the right hand plot begins just before halfway and ends at the far right.

### Extended formula interace of `lattice`

You are probably beginning to realize that data in a tall or long form is easier to plot than data in a short or wide form. Sadly, exactly the opposite is true for creating human-facing tables. So a skilled data analyst is adept at reshaping. That topic is covered more here (link to future reshaping topic). Feeling lazy? `lattice` does offer one trick that may let you get away with short/wide data: the extended formula interface.

Consider one of our [data aggregation tasks](hw03_dataAggregation.html): looking at different measures of spread for life expectancy over time, across different continents.

```{r}
lifeExpSpread <- ddply(jDat, ~ continent + year, summarize,
                       sdGdpPercap = sd(gdpPercap), iqrGdpPercap = IQR(gdpPercap),
                       madGdpPercap = mad(gdpPercap))
head(lifeExpSpread)
```

In our aggregated result `lifeExpSpread`, each measure of spread exists as its own variable. Let's say we want to plot those over time, distinguishing the different measures via color and superposition or by multi-panel conditioning, possibly depicting continent as well. To use the native `lattice` functionality for superposition or conditioning, we would need to reshape the data. The variables `sdGdpPercap`, `iqrGdpPercap`, and `madGdpPercap` would need to be catenated and a parallel factor created to indicate `sd` vs `iqr` vs `mad`. If you have no other need for such reshaped data, you can bypass its creation by using the extended formula interface.

```{r fig.show='hold', out.width='50%', out.extra='style=""'}
## cheap trick? using lattice's extended formula interface to avoiding reshaping
xyplot(sdGdpPercap + iqrGdpPercap + madGdpPercap ~ year, lifeExpSpread,
       subset = continent == "Africa", type = "b", ylab = "measure of spread",
       auto.key = list(x = 0.07, y = 0.85, corner = c(0, 1)))
xyplot(sdGdpPercap + iqrGdpPercap + madGdpPercap ~ year, lifeExpSpread,
       group = reorder(continent, sdGdpPercap), layout = c(3, 1),
       type = "b", ylab = "measure of spread",
       auto.key = list(x = 0.35, y = 0.85, corner = c(0, 1),
                       reverse.rows = TRUE))
```
In the first figure, we focus on one continent. But we achieve an effect similar to the use of the `group =` argument by specifying multiple terms as primary variables, separated by plus `+` signs. The reshaping described above is carried out temporarily by `lattice`; in particular, a virtual factor is created to distinguish `sd` vs `iqr` vs `mad`. In the second figure, we explicitly request `group = continent` and so the different measures of spread are parcelled out to different panels, as if we had properly requested multi-panel conditioning on the virtual factor.

If you want the virtual factor to be treated as a conditioning factor, the explicit way to request is to set `outer = TRUE`. Above this is achieved as a side effect of specifying `continent` as the grouping variable. Here's a more useful, typical example of how this works:
```{r}
xyplot(sdGdpPercap + iqrGdpPercap + madGdpPercap ~ year, lifeExpSpread,
       subset = continent == "Africa", type = "b", ylab = "measure of spread",
       outer = TRUE, layout = c(3, 1), aspect = 1)
```

### High level `lattice` functions have panel functions at their heart

Functions like `stripplot()` and `xyplot()` are examples of *high level* `lattice` functions. Table 1.1 in Sarkar's `lattice` book lists 15 high level functions.

![Table 1.1 of Sarkar](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/notOcto/STAT545A/examples/gapminder/figs/highlevelLatticeFunctions.png)

We've pointed out many of the useful features in common to these functions: the `data =` and `subset =` arguments for specifying input data, the formula interface (which supports multipanel conditioning), and the `group =` and `type =` arguments. All high level functions are wrappers around lots of smaller functions that do the grunt work like set up layouts and coordinate systems, draw axes, and add graphical elements. The high level functions can be organized into groups and, within these groups, there is a lot of shared infrastructure with respect to the inner workings. It can simplify your life to understand this, so you can transfer knowledge and tricks from one function to another. Here are the functions you will use most, organized into groups:

  1. `densityplot()`, `histogram()`
  2. `xyplot()`, `stripplot()`, `bwplot()`, `dotplot()`, `barchart()`
  3. `levelplot()`, `contourplot()`
  4. `splom()`, `parallelplot()` (was `parallel()`)

Of all the lower level functions wrapped up inside a high level function, the most important one is the __panel function__, which does the actual plotting. Every `lattice` plot consists of at least one panel; in the case of multi-panel conditioning via e.g., `y ~ x | z`, there will be one panel per level of `z`. The input data is chopped into pieces called __packets__, one per panel, very much like the splitting done in `plyr::ddply()`. The panel function then plots the data from one packet into its associated panel.

Each high level function has a default panel function and, by convention, its name is `panel.` followed by the name of the high level function. When simple customizations aren't enough, the first thing to do is to read the help on the default panel function. Seriously, right now go read the help on `panel.xyplot()`! This is where you will gain deeper knowledge of the arguments available for customization. Even though these are arguments of the panel function itself, you can often set them in a high level function call, and they will be passed through due to the use of the special `...` argument (read more about that [here](block06_functions.html). In fact, you've already seen examples like this:

```{r eval = FALSE}
xyplot(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, jDat,
       grid = TRUE,
       scales = list(x = list(log = 10, equispaced.log = FALSE)),
       type = c("p", "smooth"), col.line = "darkorange", lwd = 3)
```

Call up the help file on `xyplot()` and search it for arguments `col.line` and `lwd`. You will not find them (OK, `lwd` is mentioned in the documentation about keys but that doesn't count). But you *will* find them in the help for `panel.xyplot()`. __Learn this lesson well.__ It's how you can take your `lattice` plots to the next level without too much pain.

### Customizing the panel function

Sometimes the customization you need will require you to modify the panel function. Relax! It's really not that hard and is very rewarding. We will walk through a typical process for writing a custom panel function 'on the fly'.

I present a modified excerpt from my development process for creating a single year "still snapshot" of a typical Gapminder moving bubble chart. I load a souped-up version of the Gapminder data you know and love that [1] includes some stunning country colors and; [2] is sorted by country size so little countries aren't hidden by big ones. Furthermore, since the ultimate plan is to stitch the stills together into an animation, we work with a subset of the data for just one year.

```{r}
gdURL <- "http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/notOcto/STAT545A/examples/gapminder/data/gapminderWithColorsAndSorted.txt"
kDat <- read.delim(file = gdURL, as.is = 7) # protect color
str(kDat)
jYear <- 2007
yDat <- subset(kDat, year == jYear)
```

First start with a high level function call that works, but is missing some of the cool features you want. Crawl before you walk. Walk before you run.

```{r}
xyplot(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, yDat,
       grid = TRUE, scales = list(x = list(log = 10, equispaced.log = FALSE)))
```

My first step is to specify the panel function explicitly but, of course, to specify the default. Do you think pilots switch off auto-pilot in the middle of a delicate maneuver? No, they prefer to take manual control when the plane is flying smoothly at 30,000 feet in clear skies. You will see no change in the figure, which is exactly what we want at this point.

```{r}
xyplot(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, yDat,
       grid = TRUE, scales = list(x = list(log = 10, equispaced.log = FALSE)),
       panel = panel.xyplot)
```

Now I write a custom panel function 'on the fly' but the function body just consists of the defaul panel function. Any arguments normally passed to the panel function are passed straight through to `panel.xyplot()`. I omit the plot because there is no visible change, which is exactly what I want right now.

```{r eval = FALSE}
xyplot(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, yDat,
       grid = TRUE, scales = list(x = list(log = 10, equispaced.log = FALSE)),
       panel = function(...) {
         panel.xyplot(...)
         })
```

Now I modify the a custom panel function to have arguments `x`, `y`, and `...`. If you read the help on `panel.xyplot()`, you will notice that `x` and `y` are the first two formal arguments and they do not have default values. This is why, if I want to specify any of the other arguments, I must explicitly specify `x` and `y`. Below, I take whatever would have normally been given to the panel function as `x` and `y` and am passing them straight through. I omit the plot because there is no visible change, which is exactly what I want right now.

```{r eval = FALSE}
xyplot(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, yDat,
       grid = TRUE, scales = list(x = list(log = 10, equispaced.log = FALSE)),
       panel = function(x, y, ...) {
         panel.xyplot(x, y, ...)
         })
```

Now I take control of the plotting symbol: I make it an empty circle, which happens to be symbol 21. I also scale the radius of the circle so that the area will reflect the country's population. The logic and testing of this mapping of population into circle size was done elsewhere and required some thought and care, FYI. 

```{r}
jCexDivisor <- 1500                     # arbitrary scaling constant
jPch <- 21
xyplot(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, yDat,
       grid = TRUE, scales = list(x = list(log = 10, equispaced.log = FALSE)),
       panel = function(x, y, ...) {
         panel.xyplot(x, y, pch = jPch, ...,
                      # make circle area scale with pop
                      cex = sqrt(yDat$pop/pi)/jCexDivisor)
         })
```

Now I fill the circles with the pre-chosen country colors and explicitly set the circle outlines to a nice tasteful grey.

```{r}
jDarkGray <- 'grey20'
xyplot(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, yDat,
       grid = TRUE, scales = list(x = list(log = 10, equispaced.log = FALSE)),
       panel = function(x, y, ...) {
         panel.xyplot(x, y, pch = jPch, ...,
                      cex = sqrt(yDat$pop/pi)/jCexDivisor,
                      col = jDarkGray, fill = yDat$color)
         })
```

Since I've come this far, I will go ahead and add a key to link the continents to colors (or color families, here). This has nothing to do with panel functions!
```{r}
gdURL <- "http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/notOcto/STAT545A/examples/gapminder/data/gapminderContinentColors.txt"
continentColors <- read.delim(file = gdURL, as.is = 3) # protect color
continentKey <-
  with(continentColors,
       list(x = 0.95, y = 0.05, corner = c(1, 0),
            text = list(as.character(continent)),
            points = list(pch = jPch, col = jDarkGray, fill = color)))
xyplot(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, yDat,
       grid = TRUE, scales = list(x = list(log = 10, equispaced.log = FALSE)),
       key = continentKey,
       panel = function(x, y, ...) {
         panel.xyplot(x, y, pch = jPch, ...,
                      cex = sqrt(yDat$pop/pi)/jCexDivisor,
                      col = jDarkGray, fill = yDat$color)
         })
```

To conclude, we present our starting and ending plots side by side.

```{r fig.show='hold', out.width='50%', out.extra='style=""'}
xyplot(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, yDat,
       grid = TRUE, scales = list(x = list(log = 10)))
xyplot(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, yDat,
       grid = TRUE, scales = list(x = list(log = 10, equispaced.log = FALSE)),
       key = continentKey,
       panel = function(x, y, ...) {
         panel.xyplot(x, y, pch = jPch, ...,
                      cex = sqrt(yDat$pop/pi)/jCexDivisor,
                      col = jDarkGray, fill = yDat$color)
         })
```

The differences in the code are really not that huge, considering how different the output is.

```{r}
xyplot(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, yDat,
       grid = TRUE, scales = list(x = list(log = 10, equispaced.log = FALSE)),
       key = continentKey,
       pch = jPch, cex = sqrt(yDat$pop/pi)/jCexDivisor,
       col = jDarkGray, fill = yDat$color)
```
