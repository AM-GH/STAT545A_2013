========

**The current GitHub home for this course is here <https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io>. You may prefer to visit at the [main course webpage](http://stat545-ubc.github.io).**

*Everything below here and in this repo is just as I left it back in 2013. You have been warned.*

Course content. And/or everything I've got on how to use R :)

It is processed by the R package `fileherd` (still private to JB) to produce the course website:

  * [Clean index of the main content](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/quick-index.html), unpolluted by course details
  * [Page for 2013 run of STAT 545A](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/current.html)
