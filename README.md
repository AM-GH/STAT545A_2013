# STAT 545A 2013 Exploratory Data Analysis
========

**An expanded version of this course starts September 2014. Here's where that will develop: <https://github.com/jennybc/STAT545>.**

Course content. And/or everything I've got on how to use R :)

It is processed by the R package `fileherd` (still private to JB) to produce the course website:

  * [Clean index of the main content](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/quick-index.html), unpolluted by course details
  * [Page for 2013 run of STAT 545A](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/current.html)
