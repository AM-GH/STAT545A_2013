# STAT 545A Exploratory Data Analysis
========
Course content. And/or everything I've got on how to use R :)

It is processed by the R package `fileherd` (still private to JB) to produce the course website:

  * [Clean index of the main content](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/quick-index.html), unpolluted by course details
  * [Actively changing page for current run of STAT 545A](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/current.html)
  * [General persistent landing page for STAT 545A](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/index.html)
