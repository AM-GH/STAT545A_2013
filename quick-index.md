# Doing data analysis with R: My Way

Fall 2013: I am (finally) marshalling my teaching materials in one place and exploiting modern tools! Here I will index my growing arsenal. This is unfolding in the context of the 2013 instance of [STAT 545A Exploratory Data Analysis](current.html), so you can find source in the [course github repository](https://github.com/jennybc/STAT545A)

Stuff that's deprecated or needs freshing but that's not totally embarrassing
