# Doing data analysis with R: My Way

Fall 2013: I am (finally) marshalling my teaching materials in one place and exploiting modern tools! Here I index my growing arsenal. This is unfolding in the context of the 2013 instance of [STAT 545A Exploratory Data Analysis](current.html), so you can find source in the [course github repository](https://github.com/jennybc/STAT545A)

  * [Get R, RStudio, and some add-on packages set up](block00_setup.html)
  * [Basics of R/RStudio, workspaces, and projects](block01_basicsWorkspaceWorkingDirProject.html)
  * [Basic care and feeding of data in R](block02_careFeedingData.html)
  * [R objects (beyond data.frames) and indexing](block03_basicObjects.html)
  * [Data aggregation](block04_dataAggregation.html) with `plyr`
  * [Getting data out of R](block05_getNumbersOut.html)
  * [External resources on writing your own functions](block06_functions.html) PLACEHOLDER 
  * [Overview of the R graphics landscape](block90_baseLatticeGgplot2.html)
  * [Exploring a quantitative variable with `lattice`](block07_univariatePlotsLattice.html)
  * [Be the boss of your factors](block08_bossYourFactors.html) UNDER DEVELOPMENT
  * [Exploring the relationship between two quantitative variables: A quick tour of `xyplot()](block09_xyplotLattice.html)
  - [Gateway to more advanced `lattice` usage](block10_latticeNittyGritty.html)
  - [Overview of using colors in R](block14_colors.html)
  
    
Smaller topics, in the approximate order in which students ask about them

  * [Note on custom CSS](topic10_tablesCSS.html), triggered by making attractive HTML tables in the data aggregation tutorial
  * [To tidy or not to tidy?](topic11_tidyCode.html) re: code tidying in `knitr`
  * [Writing a figure to file](topic12_writeFigureToFile.html)

Stuff that's deprecated or needs freshening but that's not totally embarrassing

  * [Data aggregation](block93_oldDataAggregation.html) with built-in functions
  * [Intro to `lattice` graphics](block91_latticeGraphics.html)
