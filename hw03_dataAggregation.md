Perform a <to be specified> set of data aggregation tasks. Make some observations on both the process and the results. Write this up in an R Markdown document, compile to HTML, publish, and link.

MORE DETAILS COMING SOON.

  * Import the Gapminder data as provided in [`gapminderDataFiveYear.txt`](http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/notOcto/STAT545A/examples/gapminder/data/gapminderDataFiveYear.txt). Perform a superficial check that import went OK.
  * <Data aggregation tasks will go here.>
  * Compile into an HTML report, using the "Knit HTML" feature of RStudio (easiest!) or by direct usage of the functions in the `knitr` and `markdown` packages. Follow the naming convention.
  * Check that the HTML report is no longer than a couple of printed pages. If longer, go back and make your script shorter.
  * Publish the HTML report on the web somewhere, such as on RPubs. Make the slug follow the naming convention.
  * Publish the R Markdown file as a Gist. See instructions for help. Follow the naming convention.
  * Add or edit a line in the Markdown file that generates this page with links to your two published items. See instructions for help.
  * DUE: Before class begins 9:30am Monday September 23.
