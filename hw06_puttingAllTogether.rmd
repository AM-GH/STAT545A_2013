Homework #6 The End: Putting it all together 
========================================================

> Follow the [existing homework submission instructions](hw00_instructions.html) __as much as possible__. By 12pm Monday Octber 21, be prepared to share your links via a Google doc. I will announce sharing on the Google Group as usual.

> Will be written up more nicely!

Outline

  * work in plain R scripts
  * bring data in
  * close inspection of variables, if non-Gapminder data
    - are there factors that need work? consider bringing in as character, working, then converting to factor
    - are there dates and times that need special handling?
  * eliminate problematic observations, e.g. Oceania
  * write cleaner data to file
  * END OF CLEANING SCRIPT
  * bring clean data in
  * do some data aggregation?
  * write results or data subsets to file and/or to many files
  * write a figure to file and/or many files
  * END OF DESCRIPTIVE STATS SCRIPT
  * write R markdown report with overview and/or an R markdown script that pulls in tables figures you created with scripts above
  * write a master R script that runs your other scripts in serial
  
I'll write up a super-specific example for Gapminder. That will be a minimal but respectable way to complete the assignment.

For people looking to take this further:
 
  * use non-Gapminder data
  * make a small website exposing the files involved above
  * manage the files involved above as a Git repository
  * put that repository on Github (that could serve as the website)
  * instead of writing a master R script, use `make` to build your analytical pipeline
  
Here some help on installing and using some of these new tools:

  * [Additional software installation instructions](https://github.com/swcarpentry/2013-10-09-canberra/blob/master/additional_software.md) from above SWC Bootcamp
  * JB __highly recommends__ the [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com) Git client. Available for Windows or Mac.
